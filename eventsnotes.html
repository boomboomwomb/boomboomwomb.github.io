    <h1>Events Committee Meeting Notes</h1>

    <h1>March 7, 2016</h1>
    <p><b>Attendees:</b> Dvo, Ashley, Dana, LZ, Sarah</p>
    <h4>Overall Thoughts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Still same structure: non-alcoholic drink option on Tuesday, alcoholic afternoon party on Wednesday, LNT on Saturday</li>
        <li>We will bring two white boards/chalkboards - one for today's events, one with the week's schedule.</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Outstanding Questions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Does anyone know camps with art cars that we could coordinate ahead of time to participate in the LNT trash fence pickup?</li>
        <li>Power: Can you power our blenders for smoothies?</li>
         <li>Jenn: Confirm deadline to get events in the book? We think April or later</li>
        <li>Sophie: Do you want to host/facilitate a transitions workshop?</li>
         <li>Chris White: Can we get a birthday cake from the bakery on the playa?</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Discuss Later</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Internal camp-only events to help with camp bonding? Over dinner?</li>
      </ul>
